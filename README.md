Code for numerical simulations of phase-cycled bSSFP profiles, code for processing phantom and in-vivo phase-cycled bSSFP data
**********
N. Plaehn & J. Bastiaansen are inventors on a patent describing ORACLE
**********
Matlab code to simulate phase-cycled bSSFP profiles (in presence of noise). Quantification of T1, T2, off-resonance and proton density using the ORACLE framework. Correction for aliasing effects in the DFT modes of bSSFP profiles. Code for reading out phantom raw data and in-vivo raw data. Code for coil combination using phase-cycled bSSFP. 
**********
Available codes: 

1) S1_ErrorAnalysis_ORACLE:

Contains the (Monte-Carlo simulation) code to simulate noisy bSSFP profiles and to determine the errors of ORACLE for T1, T2, PD and off-resonance quantification in presence of normal distributed complex noise.

2) S2_AliasingCorrection:

Contains the code to correct for the aliasing effects in modes obtained via a discrete Fourier transformation. The upper maximal error bound is calculated for different T1, T2 and off-resonance values in dependence of the number of sampled RF phase increments.

3) E1_ReadRawData_Phantom:

Contains the code to read out phase-cycled bSSFP raw data from Siemens scanners based on the data structure used for the phantom experiments. 

4) E2_ReadRawData_InVivo:

Contains the code to read out phase-cycled bSSFP raw data from Siemens scanners based on the data structure used for the in-vivo experiments. 

5) Coil_Combination

Contains a fast and easy code for coil combination using phase-cycles bSSFP data. 

6) ORACLE

Contains the code using the analytical solution functions for a bSSFP profile and the proposed aliasing correction method.

7) Aliasing_Correction_derivation.nb

Contains a Mathematica script to derive the aliasing correction equations. If you cannot open Mathematica files, the script is also available as the pdf file "Aliasing_Correction_derivation.pdf", to understand the individual steps to obtain those equations.

8) E1_derivation.nb
Contains a Mathematica script to derive the analytical expression for E1 in the paper (Eq.[7]). Alternatively a pdf file is also available as "E1_derivation.pdf"

9) M0_derivation.nb
Contains a Mathematica script to derive the analytical expression for M0 in the paper (Eq.[9]). Alternatively a pdf file is also available as "M0_derivation.pdf"
